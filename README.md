# Lord of the Ping
This was a technical challenge set by DevelopMe as a final project at the end of the Coding Fellowship. 

This app is a tool to create random pairings for a match, from given names, for a Ping Pong tournament. It is built with React and Redux. 

A working version of the app can be found here: https://rohanharris.github.io/ping-pong-app/


## The Brief

The core of the challenge is to create a tool which randomly creates pairings for a table tennis tournament bracket from a list of names collected from the user.

It's up to you how you implement this, with JavaScript, React, or PHP, as a web page, or as an app.


## SetUp Instructions

1. Set up a repo locally
2. Run git clone git@github.com:rohanharris/lordoftheping.git <desired sub-directory>. This will clone the project to your desired folder.
2. Go to your project directory and run npm install. This will install any dependencies into the local node_modules folder.
3. Run npm start.
4. This will open http://localhost:3000 in the browser where you can view the app and the files will be available to see in your code editor. 
  
  
## The App

I started by planning the basic functional design using Balsamiq to create a wireframe before moving on to creating the challenge. I decided to use React and Redux as I felt comfortable using React to create components and needed to practice Redux and state management. 

The skills I used creating this app are:

1. HTML
2. CSS
3. JavaScript
4. JSX
5. React
6. Redux
7. Version Management with Git and GITHUB
8. Wireframes


I created a basic front page where the players names can be added. These are then added to a list on the same page, so that they can be seen, and a clear button was created so that the list can cleared and recreated. Once all the players names have been entered, the user clicks the button to take them to the match page where a list of matches can be found. 


## Further Work

* I would like to add more fuctionality to the app, such as a delete button for each individual player and a scoreboard on the match page.
* Add more form validation so only a valid name can be entered.
* Implement Laravel to practice my backend skills. 


## Reflection

* I decided not to use bootstrap and create my own custom CSS files. The file structure could be better and I could implement an atomic design into this. 
* I would also like to learn more about SCSS, and implement it. I decideded not to as this was only briefly touched on during the course.
* I would like to focus much more on accesibility so that everyone can have a great user experience. 
* Learning Redux (as I missed a lot of the teaching on the week it was taught) and using it to create the app was a challenge. I feel like the app could now be       made in less time and so more functionality could be added.
